# Rock Paper Scissor

Hello Everyone,

Welcome to my Rock-Paper-Scissor repository. I have developed this repository as part of **The Odin Project**. This is a basic imitation
of commonly played game with the same name.

## About the game

This game is basically involves comparison of choices made by two players and determine which choice has higher priority in comparison to
other one. Following are the established order:

1. Rock > Scissor
2. Scissor > Paper
3. Paper > Rock

As we can see a cyclic order established between the three possible choices so an interesting game happens.

The format of this game is **Fastest Five**, which means the player first to win five points is the winner and game is over at that point.
There can be any number of rounds held but the game is over only when one of the player achieves 5 points.

## Technology Used

In this project, we have used HTML, CSS and Javascript only. The main goal of this game was to learn about DOM manipulation.
